        <h1>Photography</h1>
        <p>I have been interested in photography for a mjority of my life. The past four years, I've worked hard on learning and perfecting a photographic style to the point where it's my whole life. I haven't gotten bored of it yet, and it never loses my interest. Eventually, I hope to make it my primary source of income, whether it be basic portraits or producing series of photos.</p>
