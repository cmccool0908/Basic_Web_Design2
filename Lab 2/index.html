    <h3>"I use and prefer the Fujifilm X-Pro 3."</h3>
    
    <p>The Fujifilm X-Pro 3 was a controversial camera upon release due to its lack of a visible back LCD screen. For the same reason, the camera is innovative and continuing the legacy of classic film cameras. The lack of a back LCD forces the user to be more in the moment and take the photograph rather than going back for constant review. However, if you do want to review the shots, the camera's LCD flips downward and is revealed from being hidden in the flushed body style.</p>

    <p>I've used the X-Pro 3 consistently for a year now. Out of every system that I have used and experimented with, it seems to be the best fit for me and my uses. It is the only camera that I have decided to use every day as well.</p>
