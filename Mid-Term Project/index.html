            <h1>The Black Ops Series: Trash to Stash</h1>
            
            <p>The Call of Duty franchise of games is widely popular on console and PC, but which part of the series are people most into? From personal observation, I've seen more people into the Black Ops side of the franchise than anything. With the most recent installation in the game series, (Black Ops: Cold War), I thought it would be a perfect tine to give my personal opinion on the Black Ops games, rating them from Trash to Stash. (Stash meaning it hits, it's in the bag, it's a straight banger etc).</p>
            
            <p>Of course, this is only my personal opinion. Anyone can feel any way they want to about a game, but I hate a couple of these and what better way to address it than building a whole website about it so I can better categorize my unnecessary rage.</p>
