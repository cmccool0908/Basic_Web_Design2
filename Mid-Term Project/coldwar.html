            <p>I was skeptical about Cold War in the beginning. At first, I definitely did not want to spend 60 dollars on a video game and I was concerned with how it would be considering how rough the past two installments of the Black Ops series were. But, I caved and spent the money on it.</p>

            <p>Cold War is extremely reminiscent of the classic Black Ops games and even older COD games with a new age twist (not a futuristic one). It is visually beautiful and I have absolutely no complaints thus far. This game will easily go in the stash and down as one of my all time favorite first person shooters. </p>
