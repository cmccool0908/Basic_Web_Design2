            <p>Where do I start? Both of these games were absolute hot garbage. I will never udnerstand the developers and their heinous ideas of making these games "futuristic." Both of these are atrocious Halo wannabe games with garbage features and they both run like garbage on the consoles they were released on. I've had the pleasure of playing one match on these games a piece. Never in my life have I been so disappointed with any video game ever. </P>
                
                <p>Both of these go straight to the trash.</p>
