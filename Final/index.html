            <h2>Welcome To Yet Another Rant!</h2>
            <p>In the oversaturated world of photography, you run into a whole lot of gear heads. Which is totally fine, technology is cool. But, you run into gear heads who think having a camera with the most hype behind it is going to magically make you a better photographer. I don't get enough chances to rant about this, and I feel like I repeat myself to folks all too often in when we have this conversation.</p>
            <p>This site is purely dedicated to overhyped cameras (or a collection of them). Chances are, you've heard someone talk about one of these types of cameras. I'm here to explain them to you in the simplest way possible while also telling you why they are all overplayed.</p>
        
            <h3>What to Expect</h3>
            <p>A lot of anger about things that normal people wouldn't be mad about. I tried my best to put together a portfolio, but got so angry. So, I decided to take out my pure frustration on a subject that I actually am very opinionated on. Cameras, hipsters and everything in between.</p>
