                <h2>Canon</h2>
                <p>Canon has been a major camera manufacturer since 1937, but for some reason that does not stop them from making expensive hunks of plastic. All the hype is around Canon colors amongst their user base, but most Canon cameras feature almost-lowest tier sensors and technology. Their flagship sensor only has a basic CMOS sensor and only 12 stops of effective dynamic range.</p><br>
                <p>Don't get me wrong, Canon can produce some nice equipment such as a 5D Mark IV (their flagship full frame DSLR with specs mentioned above), but that still doesn't take from the fact that the UI is outdated and so is the toy plastic housing the hardware.</p><br>
                <p>My biggest quarrel with the company and camera brand itself has to be the user base. For example, <a class="ytlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW8tr4j1ZWE">I just picture this guy, </a>and his entire being should be a prime example.  </p><br>
